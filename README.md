# first-game
This was my first ever game made. It's a simple guessing game where a random number is generated in a range of (0 - 50) and the player need to guess which number is. 
There are 3 levels(btw, the only difference is the attempts number :9)

A very simple project, tbh, but I was able to understand the basics of C, adding the colors helped me a lot to understand the #DEFINE
